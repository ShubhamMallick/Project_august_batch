# Forest Fire Prediction Project

This project aims to predict forest fire occurrences based on meteorological and environmental features using a **Logistic Regression** model. The dataset contains various features, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other environmental factors, which are crucial for predicting the likelihood of forest fires. The target variable is binary: **0** indicates no fire, and **1** indicates that a fire occurred.

The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques, specifically **Logistic Regression**, can be applied to classify binary outcomes. The project also focuses on data preprocessing, feature scaling, model evaluation, and saving the trained model for future predictions.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is based on real-world meteorological data and contains information about forest fires. It includes the following columns:

- **day**: Day of the month
- **month**: Month of the year
- **year**: Year of the observation
- **Temperature**: Temperature in Celsius
- **RH**: Relative Humidity
- **Ws**: Wind Speed (m/s)
- **Rain**: Rainfall (mm)
- **FFMC**: Fine Fuel Moisture Code
- **DMC**: Duff Moisture Code
- **DC**: Drought Code
- **ISI**: Initial Spread Index
- **BUI**: Buildup Index
- **FWI**: Fire Weather Index
- **Classes**: Target variable indicating whether a fire occurred (`1` for fire, `0` for no fire)
- **Region**: The region where the data was collected (not used in the analysis)

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**: The dataset does not contain any missing values, so no imputation was needed.
2. **Feature Selection**: The `day`, `month`, `year`, and `Region` columns were dropped as they were not contributing to the prediction.
3. **Class Encoding**: The `Classes` column was converted from categorical labels ("fire" and "not fire") into numerical values (`1` for fire and `0` for no fire).
4. **Scaling**: The features were scaled using **StandardScaler** to normalize the data, improving the performance of the Logistic Regression model.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Descriptive Statistics

The dataset contains 243 observations. The mean values for each feature are as follows:

- **Temperature**: 32.15°C
- **Relative Humidity (RH)**: 62.04%
- **Wind Speed (Ws)**: 15.49 m/s
- **Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)**: 77.84
- **Drought Code (DC)**: 49.43
- **Fire Weather Index (FWI)**: 16.69

#### Visualizations

- **Box Plots**: Used to understand the distribution of the features before and after scaling.
- **Correlation Heatmap**: A heatmap was generated to visualize the correlation between the features.

## Model Training

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. The features were scaled using **StandardScaler** to ensure that all variables were on the same scale. The **Logistic Regression** model was trained on the scaled training data, and the performance was evaluated on the testing set.

### Model Evaluation

- **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the model's performance in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
- **Accuracy Score**: The accuracy of the model is calculated, giving insight into the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Classification Report**: A classification report was produced, providing precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for both classes (0 and 1).

### Visualization

A **Heatmap** of the confusion matrix is displayed using Seaborn, offering a visual representation of the model’s classification results.

## Next Steps

1. **Model Selection**: Experiment with other machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model’s hyperparameters to enhance performance.
3. **Model Deployment**: Implement the model for real-time predictions or integrate it with web services.

## Model Saving

Once the model was trained and evaluated, it was saved using **pickle**, allowing for future use without the need to retrain the model. The saved model is stored as `Classification.pkl`.

To load the saved model and make predictions, you can use the following code:

```python
import pickle
with open('Classification.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)
```
